				h1 About the authors
				p
					| Matthew Lowman is a student at UWA studying in the second year
					| of a Master of Information Technology.  I also work as an IT consultant for a global service integration company.

					| Kit Buckley is a final year student at UWA studying a Master of Information Technology.

					| We have built this site from the ground up, using the express and bootstrap templates.  If you wish to contact us
					| in regards to the content or design of the website, please email me us at 10420746@student.uwa.edu.au (Kit)
					| or 21944708@student.uwa.edu.au (Matthew).
				
				h1 Our matching algorithm
				p
					| Our matching algorithm is based around the following parameters:
					| There must be a job registered, the tradie must have the skill to do the job
					| and the distance of the job must be within the tradie's maximum distance that
					| they are willing to travel. If this is the case, then each job will be 
					| output in a different colour, depending on the quality of the match.
					| The quality is determined by the formula 100 - ((50 * job distance)/ tradie's maximum distance),
					| meaning that all scores will be between 50 and 100%.
					| If a job has a score of >=80%, it will be printed in blue, if the score is >= 60, it will be printed in yellow,
					| and a score of < 60 will be printed in red.
				p
					| As we were unable to get geographical matching, via Google Maps working in time
					| for our submission of this project, we were unable to properly implement this
					| matching algorithm. However, the code for it has been included, and demonstrates
					| our intentions for how the system should work. The code for it is in
					| public/javascripts/matchingAlgorithm.js
				
					
				h1 Architecture and design choices
				p
					| Our page uses the MVC architecture.
					| 
				p
					| We made a decision not to use Angular, as it would require a considerable amount
					| of refactoring of our existing code.
				
				
				h1 Difficulties faced
				p
					| One challenge faced was the lack of familiarity with all the technologies
					| involved in the second part of the project. This made it very difficult to
					| debug, as some errors, such as incorrectly indented jade, were difficult
					| to identify. By collaborating closely on this project, by using a shared Dropbox
					| account and through several sessions working in person with each other, we were
					| able to work through and identifier some of these problems.
				p
					| Another difficulty faced was with the implementation of a javascript clock
					| that tracked the current time in the footer. Although we found that this worked perfectly
					| for the first part of our projects, we had problems getting this to work in Part 2,
					| which we suspect was due to the different architecture of the project, and also the
					| use of the bootstrap framework for the first time.
				p
					| We had challenges with getting initialising Mongo and Mongoose, so for the early part
					| of our project, we used separate databases, before starting a shared
					| Dropbox and creating shared accounts on mLab.
				p
					| Although we were not able to achieve all of the features and functionality we initially
					| set out to do in Part 1 of our projects, we still learnt a lot from working on this project,
					| and the experience gained, through applying Agile development principles in a collaborative
					| environment, will prove invaluable for future projects.
